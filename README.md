Used Flexbox for the alignment of the characters and the background. Used JavaScript for each character that the user clicks on, their associated background images will appear.

## Optimizations

If/When I improve this project, I would start by adding more One Piece characters into the mix and include a download button so that the background image can be downloaded onto the users device.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use Flexbox to allow for equal space between the characters. Also, separation of concerns.
